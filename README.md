Thank you for your email. I tried to complete the tasks you provided as best as I could, but unfortunately, the two-day timeframe wasn’t enough. I couldn’t dedicate my full two days to this, so I used AI tools to help me finish on time. To briefly summarize what I accomplished:

-On the frontend side, I can say I almost achieved what I aimed for. This was my first time working with React, but I managed to create something that seems to work across different platforms.
-On the backend side, I was able to test API requests; my POST and GET methods are functional, but I only tested them through Postman, so I couldn’t fully integrate the project. I also managed to set up MongoDB and add it to the backend, but I didn’t have the chance to explore the Stripe API.

I believe I learned a lot from this experience, even though this was all I could complete within such a short timeframe. As I mentioned, the frontend and backend are currently separate and not integrated yet. Thank you for your interest. Since I’ve primarily developed games in Unity for 3, I was quite unfamiliar with the technologies you mentioned, which likely slowed me down. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards, and thank you again.
